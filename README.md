# IndexingBenchmarks.jl

The purpose of this repo is to collect as many user codes as possible
on for the Indexing benchmarks. Primarily the goal is to evaluate
performance and correctness impacts for array views.

If this effort is successful, it will also create a body of user codes
that we can use for longer term performance testing and integrate with
@jrevels 's work in JuliaCI.

To contribute your code to this benchmark, please submit a PR to the
following repo, along with any data (hopefully a few MBs at most) and
also a way to check for correctness.

It will help if the total runtime can be kept to under 30 seconds.
